The Vehicle Industry Research Center has been working since May 2011 in Gyor, Hungary at the Sz√©chenyi University. Understanding and researching how people and vehicles cooperate is an essential skill when designing the future of traffic. We believe that fully self-driving (a.k.a. autonomous) technology can lead to safe, easy, and sustainable transportation. We are preparing for this new technology-to-come by studying and researching its fundamentals and exploring the possibilities it offers. This process helps us gain unique knowledge on the mixed field of mechatronics, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Future transportation can be safe, easy, and sustainable without compromises.

One of our most researched topic is self-driving (a.k.a autonomous) vehicles. We believe that fully self-driving technology can lead to safe, easy and sustainable transportation.
