    abstract      = {In a vehicle, wheel speed sensors and inertial measurement units (IMUs) are present onboard, and their raw data can be used for localization estimation. Both wheel sensors and IMUs encounter challenges such as bias and measurement noise, which accumulate as errors over time. Even a slight inaccuracy or minor error can render the localization system unreliable and unusable in a matter of seconds. Traditional algorithms, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), have been applied for a long time in non-linear systems. These systems have white noise in both the system and in the estimation model. These approaches require deep knowledge of the non-linear noise characteristics of the sensors. On the other hand, as a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), neural network-based (NN) algorithms do not necessarily have these strict requirements. The current paper proposes an AI-based long short-term memory (LSTM) localization approach and evaluates its performance against the ground truth.},
