On the other hand, <code>ROS 2</code> already supports running on native Windows, Mac OS or other Real-Time operating systems. So basically there are four options:</p> <ol> <li>Dual boot, native Linux installed alongside Windows (mostly Ubuntu) \u2705 description</li> <li>Windows WSL2, lightweight Linux virtual machine \u2705 description</li> <li>Virtual machine for Windows \ud83d\udfe0</li> <li>Windows build \ud83d\udfe0</li> </ol> <p>We recommend the first two of these 4 options, but of course the others are not prohibited either. Dual boot provides an insight into the Linux world, which is useful knowledge for an engineer today. Care must be taken during installation, as a wrong setting causes data loss, so a backup is also recommended. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a lightweight compatibility layer for running Linux-based components on Windows 10 or Windows 11-based systems. As you can see in the following figure, the Linux kernel can access the hardware elements (CPU, memory, GPU) just as easily as the Windows kernel. Compared to this, the virtual machine (option 3) is a much slower solution that uses more abstraction layers, and is recommended for those who either have a very modern, fast machine or have already installed such systems. The native Windows build (option 4) is a given in principle, but since the majority of the documentation is available for Linux, it will mean a lot of extra work.</p> <p>Illustration of the first three options:</p> <p></p> <p>The following description applies to Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy.

In 2017, the robotics community realized that the original 2007 concept has fundamental limitations that unfortunately cannot be improved in such an incremental way. Thus, in the end, Noetic Ninjemys (supported until 2025) is the last release of <code>ROS 1</code>, instead <code>ROS 2</code> started to be developed in parallel. This also means that it is more difficult to port the previous source codes to the new version, in return we can get a lot of new features, improvements, and support for the robots and vehicles to be developed.</p> <p>As a result of the above, <code>ROS 2</code> moved from the world of academic research to industrial use. It is interesting that NASA's VIPER lunar rover also runs <code>ROS 2</code>. It is also used by automotive giants such as Bosch, BMW and Volvo.

Obviously, this also has advantages (learning, running speed, etc.). But soon we will need an algorithm that has been implemented by others, but is not compatible with the original idea. Here it is advisable to consider using a framework (e.g. <code>ROS 2</code>). Note that <code>ROS 2</code> is not the only option, there are many similar, smaller frameworks: Player, YARP,  Orocos, CARMEN, Orca, MOOS, and Microsoft Robotics Studio. Obviously, all of them have advantages, but in this case, due to the support, we narrow it down to <code>ROS 2</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Image source: ros.org/blog/ecosystem</p> <ul> <li>Plumbing: ROS basically provides a messaging system, often called \"middleware\" or \"plumbing\". Communication is one of the first needs that arise when implementing a new robotics application or any software system that is connected to hardware. The built-in and well-tested messaging system of ROS can save time, since it handles the details of communication between decentralized nodes, it does not need to be implemented separately. It is even possible to directly access memory on a machine using intra-process communication.</li> <li>Tools: Developing effective applications requires good development tools. ROS has such tools including: debugging (<code>rqt_console</code>), visualization (<code>Rviz2</code>, <code>Foxglove Studio</code>), plotting (<code>rqt_plot</code>, <code>Foxglove Studio</code>), logging (<code>mcap</code>) and replay.</li> <li>Capabilities: Whether it's a GPS device driver, a gait and balance controller for a quadruped robot, or a mapping system for a mobile robot, ROS has solutions to the problem. From drivers to algorithms to user interfaces, ROS provides the building blocks that allow you to focus on your application.</li> <li>Community: Behind ROS is a large, global and diverse community. From students and hobbyists to multinational companies and government agencies, all segments of people and organizations operate the <code>ROS 2</code> project. This is also important because a lot of questions will arise during development. Most of these have already been answered by the community, and they are usually happy to answer new questions.</li> </ul> <p>The following figure shows the nodes (programs) and topics (~communication) of a simple line-following robot:</p> <pre><code>graph TD;\n\n    camd([/cam_driver]):::red --&gt; im1[ /image1&lt;br/&gt;sensor_msgs/Image]:::light\n    im1 --&gt; li1([ /line_detect_node]):::red\n    im1 --&gt; st1([ /stop_detect_node]):::red\n    li1 --&gt; li2[ /line&lt;br/&gt;example_msgs/Line]:::light\n    st1 --&gt; st2[ /stop&lt;br/&gt;example_msgs/Stop]:::light\n    li2 --&gt; nav([ /line_detect_node]):::red\n    st2 --&gt; nav\n    nav --&gt; cmd[ /cmd_vel&lt;br/&gt;geometry_msgs/Twist]:::light\n    cmd --&gt; control([ /robot_control]):::red\n    n1([ /node]):::white -- publishes --&gt; t[ /topic&lt;br/&gt;msg_type]:::white\n    t -- subscribes --&gt; n2([ /node]):::white\n    classDef light fill:#34aec5,stroke:#152742,stroke-width:2px,color:#152742  \n    classDef dark fill:#152742,stroke:#34aec5,stroke-width:2px,color:#34aec5\n    classDef white fill:#ffffff,stroke:#152742,stroke-width:2px,color:#152742\n    classDef red fill:#ef4638,stroke:#152742,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff</code></pre> <p>Source: Bestmann, Marc &amp; Fakult\u00e4t, Min &amp; Zhang, Jianwei &amp; Hendrich, N..
